# Project Overview:
This repository showcases the culmination of my efforts during the DTI Data Science program at Purwadhika. The primary focus of this capstone project is on real estate management.

# About the Project:
Developed a Python-based Real Estate Management System focused on CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for seamless data management. The system includes a feature to store and track real-time data on property purchases and rentals, enabling instant profit and rental period analysis. Additionally, graphical visualizations are provided to support profit analysis and enhance decision-making.
